Timeline

Step 1 – 2024: Birth of Nutaan
Nutaan's journey was not easy. In July 2024, we set out to build our own proprietary foundational model from scratch.
Having limited resources and funds, we faced countless hardships in this journey.
Undeterred, we pushed forward and launched our basic model in November 2025, though many features were unfinished.

Step 2 – 2025:
After three months of research, we introduced deep searching with multi-step reasoning in February 2025, marking a major breakthrough in the AI world.

How Nutaan was Trained?

Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)
Model Distillation
This process involves training a smaller "student" model to replicate the behavior of a larger "teacher" model.
It is an innovative technique to train the model in less memory.
Nutaan's training algorithms are different from those of other models—it requires less than $200k to train the 20B-parameter model.

Model Benchmarks

Hallucination Rate: 2.3%
Graduate Level Reasoning: 75%
Self Correction Rate: 71%
Nutaan outperforms several model benchmarks, exhibiting a lower hallucination rate and higher accuracy.

Competitive Advantage

Market Opportunity
Research indicates that the global LLM market for enterprise use was valued at approximately USD 5.6 billion in 2024,
with estimates suggesting a market size of around USD 7.4 billion in 2025 (Grand View Research).
This figure is supported by Precedence Research, which calculates the market at USD 7.77 billion in 2025,
projecting growth to USD 123.09 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 35.92%.

Business Model

Healthcare RCM
Nutaan can save millions of dollars and thousands of hours for healthcare providers, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

Finance and Banking
By processing large volumes of financial data, Nutaan can aid in risk assessment, fraud detection, and customer service automation.

Legal Advisory
Nutaan can process legal documents and content creation for e-drafting, contract management, research and summarization.

Target Sectors
Approximately 42% of companies globally haven’t started using LLMs, given over 300 million companies worldwide.

Size of the Market

Total Available Market (TAM): 2.85 B
Serviceable Available Market (SAM): 0.57 B
Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): 57 M

Our target regions are India, UAE & USA.
USA's market size in 2025 is approximately USD 2.122 billion.
India's market size is approximately 0.3 * 2.205 = USD 0.6615 billion.
Assuming the UAE has 20% of MEA's market, its market size is 0.2 * 0.3675 = USD 0.0735 billion.
